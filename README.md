# ONS-API-Data-Scrape
A json file (and the script to create it) containing context, name, dimensions and dimension items for all datasets available via the ONS API service.

NOTE - the webscrape on this page only deals with the Economic and Social datasets. I will be adding the Census datasets in the next few days (written 25/2/2015) as  it'll take a while to scrape given the amount of data involved.
